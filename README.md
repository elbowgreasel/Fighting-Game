fighting game I am working on.

The video I am working from: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyqbNFMDRGQ

Currently allows inputs from two players.

Player:

W: Jump

A: Move Left

D: Move Right

SpaceBar: Attack

Enemy:

ArrowUp: Jump

ArrowLeft: Left

ArrowRight: Right

ArrowDown: Attack

I plan on adding some animations/graphics.
